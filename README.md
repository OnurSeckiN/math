# Discrete Mathematics for Computer Science Specialization

#### Mathematical Thinking in Computer Science
#### Combinatorics and Probability
#### Introduction to Graph Theory
#### Number Theory and Cryptography
#### Delivery Problem

Discrete Mathematics is the language of Computer Science. One needs to be fluent in it to work in many fields including data science, machine learning, 
and software engineering (it is not a coincidence that math puzzles are often used for interviews). 
We introduce you to this language through a fun try-this-before-we-explain-everything approach: first you solve many interactive puzzles that are carefully designed specifically for this online specialization, and then we explain how to solve the puzzles,
and introduce important ideas along the way. We believe that this way, you will get a deeper understanding and  will better appreciate the beauty of 
the underlying ideas (not to mention the self confidence that you gain if you invent these ideas on your own!). 
To bring your experience closer to IT-applications ,we incorporate programming examples, problems, and projects in the specialization.
